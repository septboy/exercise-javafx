# s1p-stocks-ui

This project contains two modules:

 - A Java client that connects via REST & RSocket to a Kotlin service which streams a randomly generated set of prices. 
 - A JavaFX user interface that displays the updating prices in real time on a line chart.
 
This project was created to demo at [SpringOne Platform 2019](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/fully-reactive-spring-kotlin-and-javafx-playing-together/), and forms the basis of an IntelliJ IDEA tutorial showing how to build Reactive applications with Kotlin, Spring, Java and JavaFX.
